# Project Charter

## Description
The **Lux AI Season 3** competition challenges developers to create an AI agent to tackle a 1v1 multi-agent game in a partially observable environment. The game requires AI agents to adapt to constant environmental change to strategically balance resource management, decision-making under uncertainty, and long-term planning to get an edge over competing agents.

The core problems involve **reinforcement learning (RL)**, **imitation learning**, and **meta-learning**, which help create a model that can be generalized across different scenarios and opponents. This project is significant for various fields, such as **adapting to market changes in real-time in financial modeling**, **adapting to new medical conditions to assist in medical diagnosis**, and more.

## Scope
This project will focus on:
  - Developing an **AI agent** capable of competing in Lux AI
  - Implement **reinforcement learning strategies** to optimize agent performance
  - Train agent to **adapt to numerous known and unknown scenerios**
  - Submit the agent on **official leaderboard** for benchmarking
    
What the project will deliver:
  - A fully functional **AI agent** capable of competing in the Lux AI Season 3 competition.
  - Interactive **dashboard** for **performance analysis report**
  - **Final submission** for ranking
